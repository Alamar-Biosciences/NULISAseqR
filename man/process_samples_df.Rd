\title{Clean and standardize a NULISAseq samples data frame}
\usage{
process_samples_df(df, numericCovariates)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame of sample metadata, typically from NULISAseq data.}

\item{numericCovariates}{Named logical vector indicating which columns should be treated as numeric (TRUE) or factor/character (FALSE).}
}
\value{
A cleaned and standardized data frame with:
  - Columns converted to appropriate types (numeric, factor, character)
  - Covariate levels cleaned of punctuation
  - Standardized column names (e.g., wellRow, wellCol, plateGUID, plateID)
  - A `sampleID` column ensuring unique sample identifiers
}
\description{
This helper function processes a samples data frame from NULISAseq data, converting columns to appropriate types, cleaning covariate levels, renaming columns for consistency, and ensuring required identifiers are present. Used internally for data preparation and merging.
}
\details{
- Handles both current and legacy XML column names.
- Used internally by process_loadNULISAseq and related functions.
