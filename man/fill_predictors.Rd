\title{Fill missing predictors with NA values}
\usage{
fill_predictors(x, all)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A named vector of model statistics (coefficients, t-values, or p-values)}

\item{all}{A character vector of all expected predictor names}
}
\value{
A named vector containing all predictors from 'all', with original
  values from 'x' where present and NA for missing predictors
}
\description{
Ensures a named vector contains all expected predictor names by filling in
missing predictors with NA. Used to standardize model coefficient vectors
across targets when some predictors may be absent due to singularities or
model fitting failures.
