\title{Calculate Intra-plate Coefficients of Variation}
\usage{
intraCV(
  data_matrix,
  samples,
  aboveLOD = NULL,
  exclude_targets = NULL,
  method = "count"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_matrix}{The Data matrix output from readNULISAseq.R
or normalized data from normalization functions.}

\item{samples}{A vector of length equal to ncol(data_matrix) which encodes
the sets of sample replicates that will be used to calculate intra-plate CVs. 
Can be either a numeric or a character vector, where matching entries 
represent replicates for a given sample. 
Any NAs will be excluded (it may be desirable to 
exclude negative controls or inter-plate controls, for example). 
Entries of this vector will be used to identify unique sample replicate sets 
in the results output.}

\item{aboveLOD}{Logical TRUE/FALSE matrix output by the NULISAseqR::lod()
function. Indicates which values to include / exclude in the CV calculation. 
Default is NULL, which includes all values in CV calculation.}

\item{exclude_targets}{A vector of row names or row indices representing the 
targets that should be excluded from intra-plate CV calculation. For example,
one might want to exclude internal controls. Default is NULL, which includes
all targets in the data_matrix.}

\item{method}{Use "count" (default) for unnormalized or 
normalized count data. Calculates CV using the formula 
\code{cv = sd / mean}. Use "log2" for log2 transformed data. Calculates CV using 
the formula \code{sigma = sd(x) log(2)} and 
\code{cv = 100 sqrt(exp(sigma^2)-1)}.}

\item{cv_matrix}{matrix with %CV values for each target for each 
multiple-replicate sample.}
}
\value{
A list.
}
\description{
Calculates CV% for multiple targets 
for the specified sample replicates on a given plate.
