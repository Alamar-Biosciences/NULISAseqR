targets as predictor}

\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix of normalized NULISAseq data
with targets used as predictors in rows, samples in columns. 
Row names should be the target names, and column names are the sample names.
It is assumed that data has already been transformed
using \code{log2(x + 1)} for each NULISAseq normalized count value \code{x}.}

\item{sampleInfo}{A data frame with sample metadata including the response 
variable and covariates. Rows are samples, columns are sample metadata variables. 
Linear mixed effect models will only be done on the samples in sampleInfo, or a subset of those samples as 
specified using arguments \code{exclude_samples} or \code{sample_subset}.}

\item{sampleName_var}{The name of the column of sampleInfo that matches
the column names of \code{data}. This variable will be used to merge the 
target expression data with the sample metadata.}

\item{response_var}{The name of the column of sampleInfo specifying the continuous numeric response 
variable.}

\item{modelFormula_fixed}{A string that represents the fixed effects part of the model 
formula used for the linear mixed effects model. The main effect of target expression 
will be automatically added as a predictor. Any interactions need to be specified 
in the model formula as "covariate * target". For example, 
\code{"disease + age + sex + plate"} tests for variations of outcome explained by the 
target predictor, adjusted for disease group, age, sex, and plate. \code{modelFormula = 
"disease * target + age + sex + plate"} includes both main and interaction 
effects for disease and target expression. See \code{?lmer()}.}

\item{modelFormula_random}{A string that represents the random effects part of the model 
formula on the used for the linear mixed effects model. 
For example \code{modelFormula_random = "(1|participant_ID)"} 
creates a subject specific random intercept, where the variable 
\code{participant_ID} (a column in \code{sampleInfo} data frame) denotes 
repeated measures on the same subject. For subject-specific random intercept and 
slopes (not recommended when time is categorical), 
use \code{modelFormula_random = "(1 + time|participant_ID)"}. For random 
subject nested within plate (which may be useful when analyzing
a large number of plates together), use \code{modelFormula_random = 
"(1|plate_ID:participant_ID)"}.
See \code{?lmer()}.}

\item{reduced_modelFormula_fixed}{Optional reduced model formula 
for fixed effects that contains only a subset of the terms in modelFormula. 
This could be an empty string if the full model contains only one term.
The reduced model serves as null model for a likelihood ratio test 
(LRT, which is a Chi-square test) using \code{anova()}. 
This could be useful for testing the overall significance of factor 
variables with more than 2 levels, for example, testing the overall significance 
of a categorical time effect. The reduced model uses the same random effects 
as specified in \code{modelFormula_random}.}

\item{reduced_modelFormula_random}{Optional reduced random effects formula. 
If not specified, the reduced model will use the same random effects structure 
as the full model. Specifying this allows testing the significance of random effects
components. For example, to test if participant random effects are needed, you could
specify \code{reduced_modelFormula_random = "(1|plate_ID)"} when the full model has
\code{modelFormula_random = "(1|plate_ID:participant_ID)"}.}

\item{exclude_targets}{A vector of target names for targets that will be 
excluded from the linear mixed effect models as predictors. Internal control targets, 
for example, should probably always be excluded.}

\item{exclude_samples}{A vector of sample names for samples that will be excluded
from the linear mixed effect models. External control wells (IPCs, NCs, SC,) should usually be excluded.}

\item{target_subset}{Overrides exclude_targets. A vector of target names 
for targets that will be included in the linear mixed effect models as predictors.}

\item{sample_subset}{Overrides exclude_samples. A vector of sample names 
for samples that will be included in the linear mixed effect models.}

\item{return_model_fits}{Logical \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} (default).
Should a list of the model fits be returned? Might be useful for more 
detailed analyses and plotting. However, also requires using more memory.}

\item{control}{A list of control parameters for \code{lmer} model fitting, 
created by \code{lme4::lmerControl()}. Defaults to \code{lmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")}
which often helps with convergence issues. Other useful optimizers include "nloptwrap".
Additional control parameters can help with convergence:
\itemize{
  \item \code{optCtrl = list(maxfun = 100000)} - Increase maximum number of function evaluations
  \item \code{calc.derivs = FALSE} - Skip derivative calculations if having convergence issues
  \item \code{check.conv.grad = FALSE} - Skip gradient convergence checks if needed
}
See \code{?lme4::lmerControl} for all available options.}
}
\value{
A list including the following:
\item{modelStats}{A data frame with rows corresponding to targets and columns 
corresponding to estimated model coefficients, unadjusted p-values, 
Bonferroni adjusted p-values, and Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate
adjusted p-values (see \code{?p.adjust()}).}
\item{modelFits}{A list of length equal to number of targets containing
the model fit output from \code{lm()}. Only returned when 
\code{return_model_fits=TRUE}.}
\item{LRTstats}{A data frame with rows corresponding to targets and columns.}
}
\description{
Fits linear mixed effects model to each target in the NULISAseq data set,
using univariate targets as predictors in the model
Outcome ~ univariate target predictor + ...
Outputs coefficients, t-statistics, unadjusted and adjusted p-values.
This approach tests whether each 
target's expression is associated with the outcome variable, while 
adjusting for any specified fixed effect covariates and accounting 
for random effects.
}
\details{
Uses \code{lme4} and \code{lmerTest} packages.
