\title{Safely extract and combine model statistics into a matrix}
\usage{
safe_extract_matrix(stats_list, field_name, all_predictors)
}
\arguments{
\item{stats_list}{A named list where each element contains model statistics
for one target. Each element should be a list with fields like 'coefs',
't_vals', 'p_vals'}

\item{field_name}{A character string specifying which field to extract
(e.g., 'coefs', 't_vals', 'p_vals')}

\item{all_predictors}{A character vector of all predictor names that should
appear as columns in the output matrix}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with targets as rows and predictors as columns,
  with NA values where predictors are missing for specific targets
}
\description{
Extracts a specific field (coefficients, t-values, or p-values) from a list
of model statistics and combines them into a matrix with targets as rows and
predictors as columns. Handles missing fields, NULL values, and targets with
different sets of predictors by filling missing values with NA.
