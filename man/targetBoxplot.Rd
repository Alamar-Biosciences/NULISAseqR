\arguments{
\item{data_matrix}{The Data matrix output from readNULISAseq.R
or normalized data from normalization functions (targets in columns 
and samples in rows).}

\item{title}{Title of the plot.}

\item{sortBy}{Order by which to sort the boxplots. 
Options are `'median'` for target medians, `'detect'` for
detectability (must provide LODs). If `subtractLOD = FALSE`, will only
sort by medians.}

\item{subtractLOD}{Should the target boxplot values be relative to LOD?
Default is `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, will color boxplots by detectability.}

\item{blanks}{A vector of column names that represent the negative controls.
Required when `subtractLOD = TRUE`. This is passed to the `lod()` function.}

\item{horizontal}{Should the boxplots be horizontal (target names along the 
y-axis)? Default is `FALSE` (target names along x-axis).}

\item{log2transform}{If TRUE (default), each value `x` will be transformed 
by `log2(x + 0.01)`. LOD values will also be transformed when 
`subtractLOD = TRUE`.}

\item{excludeTargets}{Vector of names of any targets to exclude from the plots 
(such as internal controls).}

\item{excludeSamples}{Vector of names of samples to exclude from plots. These 
correspond to the column names.}

\item{colors}{Optional vector of colors that will be used to color the 
boxplots. Colors should be in the same order as the targets (rows) 
in the input data (after excluding any targets in `excludeTargets`). 
If provided, will override `detectHighColor` 
and `detectLowColor` when `subtractLOD = TRUE`. 
When `subtractLOD = FALSE`, default is `'grey'`}

\item{detectHighColor}{The color that represents 100% detectability in the 
gradient color scale used when `subtractLOD = TRUE`. Default is `'pink'`.}

\item{detectLowColor}{The color that represents 0% detectability in the 
gradient color scale used when `subtractLOD = TRUE`. Default is `'blue'`.}

\item{showLegend}{Should a legend appear in the plot? Only used when 
`subtractLOD = TRUE`.}

\item{cex.targets}{Character expansion factor for target labels.}
}
\value{
Draws boxplots of target expression.
}
\description{
Makes boxplot of log2-transformed counts for each target. 
Option to show target distributions relative to the LOD (LOD is 
subtracted from each data point, so LOD becomes the zero) and color
boxplots by target detectability.
