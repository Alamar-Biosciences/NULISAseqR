\arguments{
\item{file}{Character string. Path and name of the file.}

\item{IC}{string(s) that represents the names of internal control targets. 
Default is \code{'mCherry'}.Only used for xml file formats.}

\item{IPC}{string(s) present in the sample names
that represent the inter-plate control wells. 
For example, \code{'IPC'}. Set to \code{NULL} (default) to use the 
type variable from the Barcode B file or if there are no IPCs.
Only used for xml file formats.}

\item{SC}{string(s) present in the sample names
that represent the sample control wells. 
For example, \code{'SC'}. Set to \code{NULL} (default) to use the 
type variable from the Barcode B file or if there are no IPCs.
Only used for xml file formats.}

\item{NC}{string(s) present in the sample names
that represent the negative control wells. 
For example, \code{'NC'}. Set to \code{NULL} (default) to use the 
type variable from the Barcode B file or if there are no NCs.
Only used for xml file formats.}

\item{Bridge}{string(s) present in the sample names
that represent the bridge sample wells. 
Set to \code{NULL} (default) to use the 
type variable from the Barcode B file or 
if there are no bridge samples (default).
Only used for xml file formats.}

\item{sample_group_covar}{Optional column name in the Barcode B file 
and samples data matrix output by readNULISAseq that represents subgroups
for which detectability will be calculated separately, in addition to 
overall detectability.}

\item{replace_cal_blank_zeros}{Logical TRUE / FALSE. Default is FALSE.
This parameter is passed to the applyAQ function.
If FALSE, the "a" parameter for targets with a zero blank calibrator (NC) mean
is set using the blank calibrator mean value (which would equal zero in these cases).
IF TRUE, the "a" parameter for targets with a zero blank calibrator mean
is set using the nonzero master curve "a" parameter
estimate instead.}

\item{replace_zeros_with_NA}{Logical TRUE / FALSE.
This parameter is passed to the applyAQ function.
When TRUE (default), any zero values
in the AQ data output will be replaced with NA. When FALSE, these values remain as zero.}
}
\value{
List of lists, data frames, and matrices.
Output will differ slightly depending on the input file type.
