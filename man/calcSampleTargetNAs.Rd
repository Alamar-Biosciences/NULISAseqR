\title{Identify Missing Target Entries in Sample Curve Quant}
\usage{
calcSampleTargetNAs(curve_quant, sample_matrices)
}
\arguments{
\item{curve_quant}{A character vector where each element contains semicolon-separated
target identifiers, e.g., `"R;CSF-NA"`. The "R" identifier indicates a reverse
curve target.}

\item{sample_matrices}{A character vector of sample_matrix values}
}
\value{
A two-column matrix where each row gives the (row, col) index of a match:
  - `row`: the index in `curve_quant`
  - `col`: the index in `sample_matrices` where a corresponding `"-NA"` entry was found.
  If no matches are found, returns an empty matrix with 0 rows and 2 columns.
}
\description{
This function scans a vector of semicolon-delimited target strings (`curve_quant`)
and identifies which entries contain missing targets, indicated by the presence
of `"<sample_matrix>-NA"` for each target listed in `sample_matrices`.
}
\details{
Reverse curve targets (indicated by "R" in `curve_quant`) receive special handling:
they are marked as NA for sample matrices other than "PLASMA", "SERUM", or "CONTROL".
This ensures that NPQ values are not reported for reverse curve targets in
incompatible sample matrices.

curve_quant <- c("R;CSF-NA", "F", "R;PLASMA-NA")
sample_matrices <- c("CSF", "PLASMA", "SERUM")
