\description{
This function takes the output from `loadNULISAseq` and performs additional processing and cleaning to prepare the data for downstream analysis (e.g., NAS). It standardizes sample and plate identifiers, cleans covariate names, and generates additional normalized and transformed data matrices.
}
\details{
- Removes unnecessary columns and standardizes identifiers for compatibility with downstream tools.
- Cleans covariate (column) names to lowerCamelCase.
- Adds or updates normalized and log2-transformed data matrices.
- Used internally as a pre-processing step before merging or further analysis.
