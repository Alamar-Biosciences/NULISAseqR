\title{Read and Parse QC Attributes from XML Nodes}
\usage{
readQCThresholdXMLNode(nodes, rename = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{An `xml_nodeset` or list of XML nodes (typically `<Threshold>` nodes).}

\item{rename}{Logical (default `TRUE`). If `TRUE`, renames selected attribute names:
- `"value"` → `"thresholds"`
- `"operator"` → `"operators"`
- `"properName"` → `"properNames"`
- `"explanation"` → `"explanations"`}
}
\value{
A named list where each element is a named character vector, with threshold
  names as names and attribute values as values.
}
\description{
Parses a list of XML `<Threshold>` nodes and extracts their attributes into
named vectors grouped by attribute. The output is a named list of named vectors,
where each vector corresponds to a different attribute and is indexed by the
`name` attribute from each node.
}
\details{
If the XML node has a text value (e.g. `<Threshold>0.3</Threshold>`), it will
override the "value" attribute for that node.

Optionally, the list element names can be renamed to more descriptive keys such as
`thresholds`, `operators`, `properNames`, and `explanations`.

\examples{
# xml <- xml2::read_xml("your_file.xml")
# nodes <- xml2::xml_find_all(xml, ".//Threshold")
# result <- readQCThresholdXMLNode(nodes)
