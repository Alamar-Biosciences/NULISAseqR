\title{Combine target information across multiple NULISAseq data objects}
\usage{
combine_targets(dataList, plateID, addPlateID = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataList}{A list of processed NULISAseq data objects (as returned by mergeNULISAseq), each containing a `targets` data frame.}

\item{plateID}{A character or factor vector of plate IDs for the data objects. Only required if `addPlateID = TRUE`.}

\item{addPlateID}{Logical. If TRUE (default), adds a `plateID` column to each targets data frame before merging.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
  \item{targets}{A unified data frame of all targets present in the input objects, with columns from the original targets data frames.}
  \item{excluded}{A character vector of target names that were excluded because they were not present in all input objects, or NULL if none.}
}
\description{
This helper function merges the target data frames from a list of processed NULISAseq data objects, returning a unified targets data frame and a vector of any excluded targets (those not present in all objects). Optionally, it adds a plateID column to each target data frame before merging.
}
\details{
- All targets present in all input objects are retained in the merged targets data frame.
- If some targets are missing from one or more objects, their names are returned in the `excluded` vector and a WARN is logged.
- Used internally for merging and aligning data matrices across plates.
