\title{Fix duplicate plate IDs and sample names in a NULISAseq data object}
\usage{
fix_duplicate_plates(new_object, existingSamples)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_object}{A processed NULISAseq data object (as returned by mergeNULISAseq) that may contain duplicate plate IDs or sample names.}

\item{existingSamples}{Character vector of sample names already present in the existing dataset, used to identify duplicates.}
}
\value{
The input data object with plate IDs replaced by their respective file names and sample names updated for uniqueness. All relevant data frames and matrices are updated accordingly.
}
\description{
This helper function reconstructs a processed NULISAseq data object by renaming duplicate plate IDs with their respective file names and updating sample names to ensure uniqueness. It is used internally when merging data objects to prevent identifier collisions.
}
\details{
- Updates the `plateID` field and all relevant data frames and matrices in the object.
- Appends the plate ID to duplicate sample names to ensure uniqueness.
- Used internally during merging to avoid identifier conflicts.
